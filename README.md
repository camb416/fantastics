Fantastics Wordpress Theme
===

**Description**
This is the theme for the brand new 2016 Fantastics. This theme is intended for the one and only [fantasticsmag.com](http://fantasticsmag.com) and will not
likely be of interest to the wordpress community other than for the truly curious.

**Dependencies:**
wp-better-attachments in particular is very useful for seeing attached image that are not explicitly embedded in the post body. posts-to-posts is also necessary to create the relationships between covers and stories.

```
$> wp plugin install wp-better-attachments
$> wp plugin activate wp-better-attachments
$> wp plugin install posts-to-posts
$> wp plugin activate posts-to-posts
```

```
